#   CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

In this project, I use Python and machine learning to detect fraud in a dataset of credit card transactions.
The dataset has credit card transactions, its features are the result of PCA analysis. It has ‘Amount’, ‘Time’, and ‘Class’ features where ‘Amount’ shows the monetary value of every transaction, ‘Time’ shows the seconds elapsed between the first and the respective transaction, and ‘Class’ shows whether a  transaction is legit or not.
